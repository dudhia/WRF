TYPE: enhancement
 
KEYWORDS: topo_wind=1, diurnal cycle improvement, YSU PBL only
 
SOURCE: internal + Raquel Lorente (formerly RAL) and Pedro Jimenez (RAL)
 
PURPOSE:  To improve diurnal behavior of surface wind when topo_wind=1 is 
activated. This replaces the topo_wind=1 and is not a new option.
 
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES: 

Follows paper Lorente-Plazas et al. (2016, MWR) by decreasing effects of 
topo_wind=1 option when unstable boundary-layer conditions prevail. Uses 
convective velocity and PBL height to determine instability. PBL height uses a 
hybrid tke-theta method copied from the MYNN PBL, but for YSU tke is computed 
diagnostically.
Extra code is added to compute tke, hybrid PBL height and convective velocity
within the YSU PBL, so this is the only module affected.
