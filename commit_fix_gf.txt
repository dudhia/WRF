Adding shallow and mid-level rainfall to total

TYPE: bug-fix

KEYWORDS: GF scheme, total rainfall fix

SOURCE: Laura Fowler, Georg Grell, internal

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES: 
When PRATEC and RAINCV were computed, it only used PRET, but this should be total rainfall rate
so the PRETM and PRETS components should be added. These are likely small but the error would
be a negative rainfall bias. Note that this bug has not been in any released code because it is in the
new Grell driver routine that was just added.
