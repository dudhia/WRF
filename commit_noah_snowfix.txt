Allow small amounts of snow in Noah to melt more easily

TYPE: bug-fix

KEYWORDS: Noah LSM, snow melt

SOURCE: internal, Mike Barlage

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES: 
One-line fix. Problem was that when snow water was very small (<~0.01 mm)
it did not melt easily because of approximations in skin temperature and
effect of snow fraction on it. Fix is to limit the snow fraction from getting
too small.
