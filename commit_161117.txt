TYPE: bug-fix
 
KEYWORDS: Diffusion for dx, dy different
 
SOURCE:  Pedro Jimenez
 
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES: 
In the horizontal diffusion of v, terms involving dx and dy were reversed.
This should have no impact in the usual case where dx=dy. It may have an effect
on lat/long grids, but was only introduced with the recent 3.8.1 diffusion changes.
The change involves swapping mrdx and mrdy in two lines.
