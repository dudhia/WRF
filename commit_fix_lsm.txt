Change lower limit of exchange coefficient in urban areas to 1.e-2 from 1.e-4

TYPE: bug-fix

KEYWORDS: Noah and NoahMP, urban

SOURCE: internal, Mike Barlage

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES: 
For stability reasons, CHS needs a lower limit in urban areas. Previous releases had 
reduced it to 1.e-4 in Noah urban since V3.7, but kept older value of 
1.e-2 in Noah mosaic.  V3.9 will revert to older value of 1.e-2 and 
also add this to new NoahMP urban capability. [This reverses a change
made since the last release.]
