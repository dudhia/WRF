TYPE: bug-fix

KEYWORDS: module_surface_driver.F, replace rovcp with rcp

SOURCE: internal

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES: 
In module_surface_driver.F, the physical constant Rd/cp is represented by rcp
accessed from module_model_constants USEd by this module. But a few places
have rovcp instead, which is accessed from USE module_sf_pxlsm.F and defined
separately and slightly differently there. The change affects the 5 locations
where rovcp is used instead of rcp. These are calls to scmflux (2), 
temfsfclay, idealscmsfclay, and one line in the new NoahMP urban section.
This will slightly change results with these options.
