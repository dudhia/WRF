TYPE: bug-fix
 
KEYWORDS: ARW only, Ferrier mp, CAM radiation
 
SOURCE: internal
 
PURPOSE:  Fix bug in Ferrier output and combining Ferrier microphysics with 
CAM radiation 
 
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES: 
The Ferrier microphysics has qi and not qs, but ARW still had qs for 
fer_mp_hires package. This is changed in the Registry to now use qi.
Note advection is not affected because Ferrier only advects total condensate.
ARW output for Ferrier is affected because now ice is correctly output.
CAM radiation used an old method for computing ice amount and logic
for testing for Ferrier relied on qs, so this is also updated and fixed
to directly use qi and qc. This fix does not affect Ferrier with other
radiation options, because those treat qi and qs equally with this scheme.
